I liked the customer support alot. It has great customer experience and the company focuses alot on how to have a better customer experience. Having transparency and providing better service is the core for Airtel.
"Latency experience is an important factor when it comes to rating a service provider. The lower the latency, the faster the network is. Sometimes I have faced issue with Latency but it Gets back on track after some time, so Overall I recommend Airtel!"
"The best thing I like about Bharti Airtel is its dedication to the customer. If I made any complaint with other service providers, I had to call back to register the same issue. After changing to Airtel, first of all, I never faced such problems, but whenever I encountered a problem, they created a ticket that I could refer to see the status. All this information is available on their website/app, making it easy to connect better with the company and solve problems. Their website/app contains all the information we require."
"The cost of the services they provide is a little expensive, the number of days they provide at that price is less, and the services provided on prepaid plans are less."
I faced some disconnectivity issue once to which i contacted the customer support. My issue got resolved the very next day that too was very quick and free of cost. The customer support works really well as per my experience.
" The only issue i faced was during calls. Sometimes during weak signals, the voice calls may get laggy or break a bit but it gets better once you recover your network."
I personally like because of its great customer support and they solved the issue with in one day and Airtel provides best offers and vouchers which is the best thing about them.
Costing I can say is slightly high as compared to other networks. Sometimes calls breakdown occurs in some areas which is quite disturbing but overall beacuse of its high internet connectivity overcome this issue.
I use bharti airtel for my mobile network to use internet to make calls to video call the network is very good and very strong it gives you network any rural areas.
